srd is a secure rolodesk, which is a bit of a retro name for an
encrypted set of notes.  In modern parlance, it might be called a
password vault, but the idea is to be able to write and retrieve
arbitrary bits of text.

srd is being developed on an ubuntu linux system.  There's no real
reason to suspect it wouldn't work elsewhere, but that hasn't been
tested.

At the moment, the code is incomplete.  GIT, after all, is meant for
development.
