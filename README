srd is a secure rolodesk, which is a bit of a retro name for an
encrypted set of notes.  In modern parlance, it might be called a
password vault, but the idea is to be able to write and retrieve
arbitrary bits of text.

srd is being developed on an ubuntu linux system.  There's no real
reason to suspect it wouldn't work elsewhere, but that hasn't been
tested.

There's a library (pending issue #12) if you want to use the code in
another context with minimal hacking.


Want to use it?

I believe the code works.  There are reasonably extensive regtests
that convince me of this.  Issue #5 (script test) will be sorted
shortly, though I've essentially been doing this by hand since the
commandline interface became available.  Feel free to subscribe to
that issue if it's the only thing blocking you.  Send me mail with
feedback.

A handful of minor but important features haven't been implemented
yet.  A couple opportunities for better efficiency are identified,
again, see issues for details.
