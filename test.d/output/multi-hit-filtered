[Concord Hymn]
[The Raven]
  While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
  Nameless here forevermore.
  Darkness there, and nothing more.
  Deep into the darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering, fearing
  And the only word there spoken was the whispered word,
  Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore.
  Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
  In there stepped a stately raven, of the saintly days of yore.
  Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
  Is there--is there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me I implore!"
